Tasks are:-
● Generation of new promo codes for events
● The promo code is worth a specific amount of ride
● The promo code can expire
● Can be deactivated
● Return active promo codes
● Return all promo codes
● Only valid when user’s pickup or destination is within x radius of the event venue
● The promo code radius should be configurable
● To test the validity of the promo code, expose an endpoint that accepts origin, destination, the promo code. The API should return the promo code details and a polyline using the
destination and origin if a promo code is valid and an error otherwise.
